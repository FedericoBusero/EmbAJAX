/* Basic usage example for EmbAJAX library:
   The example shows the use of connection events, the LED shows the connection state.
   The LED is blinking when waiting for a connection. When there is connection the LED is switched 
   off and flashes each time something is received. The web interface only has a slider. 

   Note that ESP boards seems to be no real standard on which pin the builtin LED is on, and
   there is a very real chance that LED_BUILTIN is not defined, correctly, for your board.
   If you see no blinking, try changing the LEDPIN define (with an externally connected LED
   on a known pin being the safest option). Similarly, on and off states are sometimes reversed.

   This example code is in the public domain. */
